# ☄️ Oraxen → Nexo

Converting from Oraxen to Nexo has been entirely automated.\
Simply put your nexo-plugin jar in your plugins folder and start your server\
Nexo will then copy over all old ResourcePack-content, Items & Glyphs from Oraxen.\
It will also copy over all settings and mechanics and make necessary changes.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Whilst migration should be flawless, it is still recommended to make a backup of your world-folders before swapping to Nexo\
There might be small oversights leading to minor loss of furniture/custom blocks
{% endhint %}

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**Put Nexo JAR in `ServerFolder/plugins`**
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Copy `plugins/Oraxen`-> `plugins/Nexo/converter/Oraxen`

The `converter`-folder does not exist by default. Simply make the new folder\
Nexo will convert the content from this folder and delete it after\
Any future packs you might get can then be put in here and it will all be converted again
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Ensure you remove Oraxen JAR from your plugins folder**

It is also recommended to go into your `Server/WORLD/datapacks` and remove any leftover packs from Oraxen
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Ensure you make a backup of your worlds**

Whilst migration should be flawless, it is still recommended to make a backup of your world-folders before swapping to Nexo\
There might be small oversights leading to minor loss of furniture/custom blocks

### ResourcePack

There are small changes in how ResourcePacks work between Oraxen and Nexo.\
The main change is that Nexo no longer has shortcut folders for `pack/models` etc.\
This has always caused lots of confusion, so Nexo follows the normal structure\
`pack/models` -> `pack/assets/minecraft/models` etc\
Nexo also allows for far easier importing of external resourcepacks.\
Simply add any ResourcePack .zip or ResourcePack-folder (MyPack/assets/...) to `pack/external_packs` and it will be included in the final pack.

### Items

Nexo will also automatically convert existing items from Oraxen -> Nexo when a player joins.\
These will also be scanned and converted where there has been changes.\
Most notably in how NoteBlock, StringBlock and Furniture-Mechanics are defined

### Furniture

Placed OraxenFurniture will also be automatically converted to Nexo-Furniture when they load.\
There might be some issues with furniture that were Item-Frame based due to Nexo only supporting ItemDisplay Furniture.\
These can just be manually replaced or via a future update\
\
Main config-changes here are with how seats, lights & hitboxes (barrier & interaction) are defined.\
Nexo allows for multiple interaction-hitboxes, seats and lights.\
Suggest reading [Furniture Mechanic](../mechanics/furniture-mechanic/) for more info

### Custom Blocks

Custom blocks will also be converted. There is a difference in the custom-variation calculation between Oraxen & Nexo. Nexo will, when importing OraxenItems' correct this custom-variation.\
Example: `custom_variation: 1` -> `custom_variation: 51`\
There are also some minor changes in how these mechanics are defined.\
Examples can be found at [NoteBlock Mechanic](../mechanics/custom-block-mechanics/noteblock-mechanic/) & [StringBlock Mechanic](../mechanics/custom-block-mechanics/stringblock-mechanic.md)\

**If there are any issues in the conversion process, let me know!**
