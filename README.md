## What is Nexo?

Nexo is an all-in-one Minecraft plugin that makes it easy for server admins to add and customize their own items, blocks, armor, and furniture to enhance their server's experience.\
By using a simple file-based configuration system, Nexo automatically handles Resource Pack generation. After generating the pack, it dispatches the pack to players on the server, allowing them to see the custom models and textures set up by the admin.\
This documentation contains a complete list of features, as well a examples of what Nexo can do! If you need further assistance, please join the Discord server with a proof of purchase.
