## What is Nexo?

Nexo is an all-in-one Minecraft plugin that makes it easy for server admins to add their own items, blocks, armor, and furniture.\
By using simple file-based configuration, Nexo automatically handles Resource Pack generation. Nexo then dispatches the pack to all players on the server, allowing everyone to see the custom models and textures set up by the admin.

This documentation contains a complete list of features, as well examples of what Nexo can do.
If you need further assistance, please join the Discord server with a proof of purchase.
