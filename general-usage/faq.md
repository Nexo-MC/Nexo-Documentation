# ❓ FAQ

## Nexo generates a resourcepack, can I still use my own?

You can merge any resourcepacks into the ResourcePack generated by Nexo.\
You can do so by simply adding the .zip or folder to `Nexo/pack/external_packs`\
and the plugin will merge it into the final ResourcePack and send it to all players.\
Check out the [resourcepack.md](../configuration/resourcepack.md "mention") page for a detailed explanation

### NoteBlocks & Tripwires aren't working correctly?

Nexo uses NoteBlocks and TripWires for custom blocks, and thus disables all their vanilla behaviour.\
Noteblock-mechanic does have an option to re-enable this without losing custom blocks, if you go to Nexo/`mechanics.yml`\
If you do not care about Custom Blocks, you can also just disable the noteblock & stringblock-mechanics in `mechanics.yml`

### How do I reference a ResourcePack file in a config?

Minecraft ResourcePacks follow a defined and consistent structure.\
ResourcePack files are also split into sub-categories; **sounds, textures, models, fonts, etc..**\
A full list of it can be found on the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Resource_pack#Directory_structure), more info on ResourcePacks in [resourcepack.md](../configuration/resourcepack.md "mention")

The **namespace** is just another way to sort said sub-categories between different usecases.\
The **filepath** is the remaining path to your file itself

When you then want to make a reference to said file in say a NexoItem, this is how you do it;

{% code title="assets/nexo/textures/item/nexo_defaults/forest_axe.png" %}
```yaml
myitem:
  Pack:
    # assets/minecraft/models/item/paper.json
    model: minecraft:item/paper.json
    # assets/nexo/textures/item/nexo_defaults/forest_axe.png
    texture: nexo:item/nexo_defaults/forest_axe
```
{% endcode %}

Here is an example to reference a given PNG Texture **or** a JSON Model.\
This is the exact same for sounds, fonts etc. Only difference is the immediate folder after the namespace is not textures

**ItemModels:**\
&#x20;assets/**NAMESPACE**/items/**PATH/FILE**.json -> `item_model: NAMESPACE:PATH/FILE`

**Models:**\
assets/**NAMESPACE**/models/**PATH/FILE**.json `model: NAMESPACE:PATH/FILE`

**Textures:**\
assets/**NAMESPACE**/textures/**PATH/FILE**.png `texture: NAMESPACE:PATH/FILE`

**Sounds:**\
assets/**NAMESPACE**/sounds/**PATH/FILE**.ogg `sound: NAMESPACE:PATH/FILE`

If your file is inside `assets/minecraft/...` , meaning your namespace is **minecraft**, specifying it in a config is optional. If no namespace is defined, it will assume you mean **minecraft**

### What is a Duration & how do I use it?

A duration is a dynamic way to specify time in a variety of ways.\
Normally plugins require you to specify in ticks or seconds only.\
Nexo allows you to more easily define a length of time with a Duration Format.\
An example is [sounds.md](../configuration/sounds.md "mention")which has a `duration` inside `jukebox_playable` to set the sound-length.\
The format for duration is a value + a suffix stamp for the DurationUnit. Some DurationUnits support non-integer values and will automatically format this into the correct values.

`duration: 20t` - 20 ticks\
`duration: 20ms` - 20 milliseconds\
`duration: 20.2s` - 20 seconds & 40 ticks\
`duration: 20.1m`  - 20 minutes and 6 seconds\
You also have <mark style="color:yellow;">h</mark>ours, <mark style="color:yellow;">d</mark>ays, <mark style="color:yellow;">w</mark>eeks & <mark style="color:yellow;">m</mark>**o**nths\
