# ‚ùì FAQ

## Nexo generates a resourcepack, can I still use my own?

You can merge any resourcepacks into the ResourcePack generated by Nexo.\
You can do so by simply adding the .zip or folder to `Nexo/pack/external_packs`\
and the plugin will merge it into the final ResourcePack and send it to all players.\
Check out the [resourcepack.md](../configuration/resourcepack.md "mention") page for a detailed explanation

### NoteBlocks & Tripwires aren't working correctly?

Nexo uses NoteBlocks and TripWires for custom blocks, and thus disables all their vanilla behaviour.\
Noteblock-mechanic does have an option to re-enable this without losing custom blocks, if you go to Nexo/`mechanics.yml`\
If you do not care about Custom Blocks, you can also just disable the noteblock & stringblock-mechanics in `mechanics.yml`
