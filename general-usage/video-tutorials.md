# 📺 Video Tutorials

Nexo itself only has written documentation in the form of this wiki.\
There is however a community made set of videos, primarily by _Turretedash7,_ for a large numbers of the features found in Nexo.

You can find a playlist for all the videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDQSwTgJzz5SG3UUNVXpI5H0kp0s9KL-q)

{% hint style="info" %}
**These tutorials are community made so information in them might be outdated.**

As Nexo updates frequently. some things might be different, removed or added after the publication of a specific video-guide, so recommend checking the relevant wiki-page if you encounter issues

It is recommended to use them as a starting guide until you get to know Nexo.\
Especially if you find written guides harder to follow to begin with.
