# üéûÔ∏è Animated Glyphs

With Nexo you can make Animated Glyphs, or GIFs, which you can use to animate GUIs or gif-emotes.\
It is very simple, Nexo does most of the hard work to convert the GIF-file to a compatible format.

Simply put your GIF-file in the resourcepack. As an example we will use `Nexo/pack/assets/nexo/textures/gifs/necoflap.gif`

### Gif-Glyph Config

```yaml
necoflap:
  gif: nexo:gifs/necoflap.gif
  ascent: 9
  height: 11
  #frame_count: X      Optional, mainly used for limiting larger GIFs
  #offset: X            Mainly if the GIF is not overlapping frames perfectly
```

Unlike normal Glyphs, font cannot be customized, as Nexo sets it for you.\
Texture-property is based on the `gif`-property and can be customized that way

{% hint style="warning" %}
GIFs rely on Core Shaders and might break on version updates.\
Large GIFs might also cause lag if the frame-count is really high, consider optimizing GIFs you intend to use
