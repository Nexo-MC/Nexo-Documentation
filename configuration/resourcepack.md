# 📂 ResourcePack

### ResourcePack-Structure

The ResourcePack in Nexo follows the vanilla structure but also letting you import and automatically merge full ResourcePacks\
This is in an effort to make importing third-party ResourcePacks a lot easier.\
Below is an example of the new structure.

{% code title="" %}
```
📁Nexo
└── 📁pack
    └── 📁assets
    │    ├── 📁minecraft
    │    │    ├── 📁models
    │    │    │    ├── 📁item
    │    │    │    │    └── 📑paper.json
    │    │    │    └── 📑custom_model.json
    │    │    └── 📁textures
    │    │         └── 🖼️something.png
    │    └── 📁custom_namespace
    │        └── 📁models
    │            └── 📑custom.json
    │  
    └── 📁external_packs
        ├── 📁DefaultPack.zip
        ├── 📁custom_resourcepack.zip
        └── 📁custom_resourcepack2
            └── 📁assets
                └── 📁custom_namespace2
```
{% endcode %}

Goal is to let users merge resourcepacks in via either ZIPs or directories, outside of the normal assets folder.\
This would dynamically merge in any conflicting files, like a paper.json or sounds.json, instead of migrating it to oraxen-configs to be generated.\
Meaning that pack-import instructions on your end now boils down to:\
Put `my_pack.zip` inside `Nexo/pack/external_packs`

### Obfuscation

Nexo has a built in way to "obfuscate" the content of your resource-pack.\
This is done by randomizing all file-names in an attempt to make it very hard and annoying to try and take stuff from it for pirates.\
It comes with three modes, `NONE`, `SIMPLE`, `FULL`\
\
**NONE** - Self-explanatory, does not obfuscate pack in any way\
**SIMPLE** - Obfuscates filenames only\
`namespace:model/path.json` -> `namespace:bba2d60b-8e3e-4051-9734-fef92766777f`\
**FULL** - Obfuscates namespace & filename;\
`namespace:model/path.json` -> `c491303e-ba1e-4037-a59d-62b5fdfb6bb8:bba2d60b-8e3e-4051-9734-fef92766777f`

### PackSquash-Integration

Nexo allows you to run PackSquash on the resourcepack without manually reuploading the pack.\
Simply download the latest [PackSquash](https://github.com/ComunidadAylas/PackSquash/releases) build and drop it in `plugins/Nexo/pack/packsquash` .\
Then drop your **packsquash.toml** in the same directory, an example can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/Boy0000/92149d2704b6086473fccb4d771c42b4).\
If you want it in another location, you can specify a path for the binary & settings

```yaml
Pack:
 generation:
    packsquash:
      enabled: true
      executable_path: plugins/Nexo/pack/packsquash/packsquash
      settings_path: plugins/Nexo/pack/packsquash/packsquash.toml
```

To enable Nexo's PackSquash-integration simply enable `Pack.generation.packsquash.enabled` in settings.yml. Then when the pack generates, it will start the PackSquash process. If it suceeds you should see somehting like the below.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (7).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Example of successful PackSquash process</p></figcaption></figure>

If it failed you should see some detailed info about which file and a reason for it.\
If Nexo's debug-mode is enabled, it will output info about all successful files aswell

{% hint style="info" %}
Depending on your TOML-configuration & ResourcePack size & complexity, the PackSquash process might take some time. Nexo will cache the output so that if the ResourcePack does not change, the PackSquash process will not need to be ran again
{% endhint %}

### PackServer

Nexo has 3 types of ways to upload & dispatch the ResourcePack it generates\
**POLYMATH** - A dedicated server hosted by Nexo-Team that your server uploads the pack to\
This server is currently hosted in Germany\
**SELFHOST** - Server-Instance hosted on your machine. Requires you to configure the `public_address` and ensure a given port is open.\
**LOBFILE** - Server hosted by [LobFile](https://lobfile.com/), needs a `api_key`in settings.yml\
The API is also set up so that one could extend the `NexoPackServer-Interface` and create ones own.

### Cross-Server/Proxy ResourcePacks

Nexo by default has no support for handling resourcepacks across a velocity/bungee network.\
This is however not inherently needed, as the player will keep the resourcepack when swapping servers, unless the new server sends a new resourcepack.

Assuming you have a Server A, Server B & Server C:

1. Set Pack.server to NONE for Server B & Server C. That way the player joins Server A and loads the resourcepack. When they then swap to Server B or C, the resourcepack from Server A will not be unloaded. The downside here is that if the player joins Server A from B or C, they will get sent the resourcepack again and load it
2. Use a plugin like [OneTimePack](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/onetimepack-avoid-double-sending-the-same-pack-bungeecord-velocity.106749/) on your Velocity/Bungee server. These plugins check the ResourcePack-request and compare them. If the pack is the same it will skip it.\
   If taking this approach make sure to either disable [obfuscation](resourcepack.md#obfuscation) for your NexoPack, or enable caching and manually copy over the .deobfCacheResourcepack folder to all servers

### Importing

Nexo lets you import Third-Party ResourcePacks in several ways.\
The recommended one is shown above, by adding a directory or .zip to \`plugins/Nexo/pack/external\_packs\`\
There is also `Plugin.import.from_location` in settings.yml, letting you specify a directory/zip relative to your plugins folder\
There is also `Plugin.import.from_url` in settings.yml, letting you specify any url that Nexo will download a directory/zip from and include
