# ⛑️ Custom Player Armors

Just like other items, armor have a texture for when it is held or in your inventory, but also a texture for when a player equips it.\
Nexo comes with two ways to add custom armor: COMPONENT & TRIMS.\
COMPONENT is for all 1.21.2+ servers and is the optimal choice for all supported servers.\
TRIMS is designed around the Armor-Trim system added in Minecraft 1.20, and will not work on earlier versions.

**Component** method is recommended for all servers 1.21.2+ in every scenario.\
There is no benefit to using Trims or Shader-methods for these servers.

**Armor-Trim** method is recommended if your server is 1.21.1 and only allows 1.20+ players.\
It has the benefit of not breaking with shaders / requiring extra mods to work.\
It requires the use of CHAINMAIL armor
