| 1.21.4                       | :white\_check\_mark: **Supported**                           |

|                              |                                                              |
| 1.20.4, 1.20.6               | :warning: [**Unsupported**](#user-content-fn-4)[^4]          |
|                              |                                                              |
| 1.20.5, 1.21, 1.21.2, 1.21.6 | :octagonal\_sign: [**Unsupported**](#user-content-fn-5)[^5]  |

[^1]: Nexo 1.16+

[^2]: Nexo 1.13+

[^3]: Nexo 1.10+

[^4]: Official support removed as of Nexo 1.13+\
    Can be used on Nexo 1.12 & older

[^5]: These versions are labelled as "**Unsupported"** because they were quickly followed by a new release to fix bugs. There is no reason to use any of these versions in favor of the above-mentioned ones.\
    \
    Nexo might still work on these releases but in no way is it ideal to use
