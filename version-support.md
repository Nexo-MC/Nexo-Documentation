# ðŸ“œ Version Support

|                              |                                                              |

[^1]: Nexo 1.13+

[^2]: Nexo 1.10+

[^3]: Official support removed as of Nexo 1.13+\
    Can be used on Nexo 1.12 & older

[^4]: These versions are labelled as "**Unsupported"** because they were quickly followed by a new release to fix bugs. There is no reason to use any of these versions in favor of the above-mentioned ones.\
    \
    Nexo might still work on these releases but in no way is it ideal to use
